I added this file to see if I could

And also to describe how I intend the webpage template to work.

Users should enter our submission, and all they will have is a single, long page.

On this page, they will be able to see how leblanc mains fared compared to non-leblanc mains against leblancs
	{or champion, really}

On the page, there will be a few graphs:
	scatter plot Champion c (main fare versus):
		x axis will be champion - where c is the main and the opponent
		y axis will be winrate
	bar graph comparability:
		x axis will be winrate (mains versus and non-mains versus)
		y axis will be winrate
    ^^^^ We could combine these 2, if we choose, but I think they are more meaningful separate ^^^^

	
There will be text describing each of these graphs
And, of course they will be populated by images


Now, we could draw these graphs every time someone visits
		Add to our calculations
		Leave our data the way it was
Or we could literally just show a picture LoloLOLlol
